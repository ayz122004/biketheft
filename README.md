# Bike Theft

The smarter way to secure your bike.

## About This Project

UC Davis has an active biking community, and bike thefts are unfortunately very common on campus. To provide a solution to this problem, we created Bike Theft™, a smart bike theft detector. It alerts the user to potential thefts, including but not limited to bike wheels, frames, and seats. Just attach the detector to the frame of your bike and set the bike to “locked” in the dashboard. Bike Theft will alert you if any suspicious or unexpected movements are detected.

## How We Built It
- TI MSP432 Microcontroller
- Adafruit IO
- C/C++
- ReactJS

## Usage

### Requirements

- TI MSP432 LaunchPad Development Kit
- TI CC3100 BoosterPack
- TI Educational BoosterPack MKII (for MCU LaunchPad Ecosystem)
- Energia
- Adafruit IO

### Development

- Clone the repo
- Open `msp432.ino` with Energia and upload to the microcontroller.
- Modify `msp432.ino` and `App.js` with your own:
  - Wifi SSID/password
  - Adafruit username/API key
  - Adafruit feed API endpoints/webhook
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
## What's next for Bike Theft
- Fine-tuning thresholds through more testing
- Extend to mobile app for user’s convenience
- Potentially implement microphone for more accurate detection
